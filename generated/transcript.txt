Hi doctor, I'm experiencing stomach pain today. Okay, how is it my problem? Well, I was having explosive diarrhea this morning and I don't know what the problem is. Yeah, but I don't care. Fucking try, fucking try, I'm trying this shit, I'm trying it. I'm fucking trying, okay? I'm fucking trying. I just hit the fucking grass. I'm trying it. You're not trying shit. Yes I am. Did you manage to pull a little more off? It's me with the explosive diarrhea, what am I supposed to say?
